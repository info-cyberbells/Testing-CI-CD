> Church Translator is a real-time web application that helps pastors and church leaders communicate sermons in multiple languages simultaneously. The admin (pastor) speaks in their native language, and users can listen in real time with instant translation into their preferred language. This project is built to make church services more inclusive and accessible across language barriers.
